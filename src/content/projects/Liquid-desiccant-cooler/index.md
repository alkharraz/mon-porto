The **Liquid Desiccant Air Conditioner** (**LDAC**) is my Senior Design Project that I and my team worked on at the University of Bahrain. This section highlights one of the main projects that I worked on in my university years.

The Liquid Desiccant Air Conditioning (LDAC) is a combination of an evaporative chiller and a dehumidifier. The dehumidifier uses a chemical solution of water mixed with CaCl2 that absorbs
moisture from the air allowing the cooling unit to operate efficiently in a humid environment like Bahrain’s. After that, the evaporative cooler lowers the air’s temperature by interacting with water spray. The sequence of execution was as followed:-
- A COMSOL simulation was performed to ensure the feasibility of the system cycle prior to
implementation.
- A preliminary CAD model was constructed using Inventor for visualization and printing out the required
Engineering drawing.
- The model was manufactured with the help of “Single Point Plastics”.
- The parts were assembled, and the required pipe fittings, pumps and fan were selected with respect to
serviceability and constraints.
- The experiment was conducted to confirm the simulation results by measuring the operating parameters
comprising, flow rate, temperature, and relative humidity throughout the LDAC cycle.

As a final point, the **dehumidifying unit reduced the relative humidity by 43.3%**, resulting in a **4 times improvement in COP** compared to the Evaporative unit alone. Moreover, if a superior dehumidification procedure is carried out under a 45% CaCl2 concentration, this project's potential COP is expected to improve by 9 times rather than the previous value.
